            Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus
            Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration
            patterns that are species-dependent. The hands and feet of slow lorises have several adaptations
            that give them a pincer-like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods of time. Slow
            lorises have a toxic bite, a rare trait among mammals.
